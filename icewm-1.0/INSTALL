1. Requirements

    - libXpm or Imlib
    - C++ compiler (tested: g++ 2.95.3, icc 5.0.1 Beta)
    - GNU make (very minor tweaks required for other make variants)

  Optional:

    - IMLIB or libXpm
    - GNOME
    - sgml2html to rebuild HTML documentation

2. Compiling

    - cd icewm-$version
    - Run './autogen.sh' when fetched from CVS.
    - Run './configure --help' to see available options.
    - Run './configure' possibly with options
    - If needed: customize sysdep.inc for your platform.
    - If needed: customize install.inc with correct installation directories.

    Please send me any changes that you may need to make.
  
    - Type 'make' to build it.

3. Installing

    Default installation path is /usr/local, if you change it by using
    configure switches like --prefix or --sysconfdir. You have to rebuild
    everything (make clean ; make) after changing the paths.

    - Type 'make install' as root user to install. (make -n install to
    verify things first if you are not sure).

4. Starting icewm
    
    Make sure the icewm executables are located on $PATH, otherwise
    it will not be possible to restart the window manager.

    Normally, icewm should be started from ~/.Xclients file. This will
    work the same for 'startx' and 'xdm' logins. The file must have execute
    permissions (chmod a+x ~/.Xclients).
    
    An example of ~/.Xclients file would be:
       |-- cut here ---------------|
        xset m 5 2
        xterm & # start xterm by default
        icewm || xterm -bg red
       |-- cut here ---------------|
